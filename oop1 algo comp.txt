oop 1 algorithm: Complex Number Operations
Start

Define a class complex with:

Two data members: real and imaginary (both of type double)

A default constructor that initializes both values to 0

A parameterized constructor to initialize values using input

A method add() to add two complex numbers

A method subtract() to subtract two complex numbers

A method multiply() to multiply two complex numbers

A method divide() to divide two complex numbers

A method display() to print the complex number

In the practice2 class:

Create two complex number objects num1 and num2 with given values (e.g., 4+5i and 6+7i)

Call add() with num1 and num2 and store the result in sum

Display the result of addition

Call subtract() and store the result in difference

Display the result of subtraction

Call multiply() and store the result in multiple

Display the result of multiplication

Call divide() and store the result in div

Display the result of division

End
