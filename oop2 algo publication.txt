Define a derived class Book that extends Publication:

Additional data member: author

Constructor to initialize title, price, copies, and author

Method orderCopies(quantity) to:

Increase copies by quantity

Method receiveIssue(issue) to:

In the practice2 main class:

Create a Book object book1 with values:
"Java Programming", 29.99, 100, "John Doe"

Create a Magazine object mag1 with values:
"Tech Today", 5.99, 50, "March 2023"

Call orderCopies(20) on book1 → adds 20 copies

Call orderQty(30) on mag1 → adds 30 copies

Call saleCopy(10) on book1 → sells 10 copies

Call saleCopy(5) on mag1 → sells 5 copies
