Algorithm: Vehicle Interface Implementation
Start

Define an interface Vehicle with the following methods:

gearChange() – to handle gear changes

speedUp() – to increase speed

applyBrakes() – to slow down or stop

Create a class Bicycle that implements Vehicle:

Implement gearChange() to simulate gear change by pedaling

Implement speedUp() to simulate pedaling faster

Implement applyBrakes() to simulate slowing down a bicycle

Create a class Bike that implements Vehicle:

Implement gearChange() to simulate shifting gears on a motorbike

Implement speedUp() to simulate accelerating the engine

Implement applyBrakes() to simulate slowing down a bike

Create a class Car that implements Vehicle:

Implement gearChange() to simulate using the gear shift

Implement speedUp() to simulate pressing the accelerator

Implement applyBrakes() to simulate using the brake pedal

In the Main class:

Create objects of type Vehicle for:

A Bicycle

A Bike

A Car

For each vehicle object:

Call gearChange(), speedUp(), and applyBrakes()

Print messages to show the behavior of each vehicle type
