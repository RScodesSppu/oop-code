Algorithm: Area Calculation Using Abstract Class
Start

Define an abstract class Shape with:

Two data members: dimension1, dimension2 (type: double)

Method inputData(d1, d2) to assign values to the dimensions

Abstract method compute_area() to be overridden by subclasses

Define a subclass Triangle extending Shape:

Override compute_area() method to compute:

Area of Triangle
=
0.5
×
base
×
height
Area of Triangle=0.5×base×height
Print the area of the triangle

Define another subclass Rectangle extending Shape:

Override compute_area() method to compute:

Area of Rectangle
=
length
×
width
Area of Rectangle=length×width
Print the area of the rectangle

In the Main class:

Create a Scanner object to read input from the user

Create an object triangle of type Triangle (as Shape)

Prompt the user to enter base and height for the triangle

Use inputData(base, height) to set dimensions

Call compute_area() to display the area of the triangle

Create an object rectangle of type Rectangle (as Shape)

Prompt the user to enter length and width for the rectangle

Use inputData(length, width) to set dimensions

Call compute_area() to display the area of the rectangle

Close the scanner
