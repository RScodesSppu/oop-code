Algorithm: Employee Payroll System
Start

Define a base class Employee with:

Data members:

empname (Employee Name)

empid (Employee ID)

address

mailid

mobileno

basicpay (Base Salary)

Constructor to initialize all data members

Method calculateGrossSalary() to compute salary using:

DA = 97% of basic pay

HRA = 10% of basic pay

PF = 12% of basic pay

Staff Club Fund = 0.1% of basic pay

Gross Salary = basicpay + DA + HRA - PF - Staff Club Fund

Method generatePaySlip() to:

Call calculateGrossSalary()

Print employee details and salary breakdown

Define derived classes inheriting from Employee:

Programmer

TeamLead

AssistantProjectManager

ProjectManager

Each class should have a constructor that calls the base Employee constructor using super(...)

In the Main class:

Create an instance of Programmer with specific details

Create an instance of TeamLead with specific details

Create an instance of AssistantProjectManager with specific details

Create an instance of ProjectManager with specific details

For each employee object, call the generatePaySlip() method to display:

Basic Pay

Gross Salary

Employee name and ID

End
